My work:
1. I created a directory called "projects"
2. Inside this directory I created three files:
  1. html-question.txt
  2. command-line-question.txt
  3. README.md
3. I initiate the folder with Git bit cd into the "projects" folder and added in the terminal "git init"
4. I checked the status in my repo by writing "git status"
5. I added ALL the files to git by "git commit add ."
6. I commit the changes by "git commit -m "my project files""
